3.  Click the **Load unpacked** button
4.  Select the `Dachshundify` folder from your computer

## Development (Optional)

This section is only for developers who want to modify the code using `web-ext` for auto-reloading. **Regular users can skip this.**

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed.

### Quick Start
1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
